# LT_SO_Behavior_Ephys_Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and documentation for the analysis of behavioral and electrophysiological data obtained from a Linear Track (LT) test used in a Social-Object (SO) discrimination paradigm. The project aims to explore social coding impairments in a schizophrenia model (Belforte et al., 2010).

## Key Features

- Behavioral tracking and analysis of social vs object interactions.
- Preprocessing and spectral analysis of LFP (Local Field Potential) signals.
- Integration of neural and behavioral data for advanced interpretation.
- Designed to support reproducibility and clarity in research pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- MATLAB (compatible with R2017a)
- Custom-built scripts for signal processing and behavioral metrics

## Use Cases

This project is suitable for researchers and analysts working at the intersection of neuroscience, behavior, and data science, and serves as a portfolio example for roles in Data Analytics and Data Science.
